### Intro:

- Not only was Project 15 the final one of the WTWR Series, but it also expanded on the interplay between Backend and Frontend, as far as Full-Stack Software Engineering goes.

- Moreover, it taught me about both Automated Testing and Advanced Middleware, with the latter being instrumental to understanding Cybersecurity.

- Thanks to Project 15, I was introduced to the work of Cloud Deployment by way of Google Cloud.

- I am confident that learning about Google Cloud will serve as a foundation to learning about AWS.
